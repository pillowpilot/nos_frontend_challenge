## Online Test

Test the project [here](http://nos-frontend-challenge.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).

## Test locally

Test the project running the following commands from the root directory:

```shell
npm install
```

```shell
npm run dev
```

and browse `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Build for production

Build the project for production with:

```shell
npm run build
```

The output should be in the `dist/` directory. Currently the bundle is less than 140kB so no code splitting is necesary.
