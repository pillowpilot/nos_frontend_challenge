## Test locally

Test the project running the following commands from the root directory:

```shell
npm install
```

```shell
npm run dev
```

and browse `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Build for production

Build the project for production with:

```shell
npm run build
```

The output should be in the `dist/` directory. Currently the bundle is less than 140kB so no code splitting is necesary.
